Please act as a biology teacher who is assessing student argumentation competence using an item about ecosystems. Judge the answers provided by student to the question displayed below. 

### Background Information
This is a biology question about a farmer who finds corn rootworms on his corn plants. The rootworms are insects that eat and damage the corn plants, resulting in a decrease in the percent corn yield on the farm. To help reduce the number of corn rootworms and keep the percent corn yield as high as possible, the farmer added natural predators of corn rootworms to the field. The predators are called harvestmen, and they are a type of spider. The farmer collected data on the amount of corn planted, amount of corn harvested, number of harvestmen added, and initial and final number of rootworm eggs in the field over five years. The data show that the number of corn plants planted each year remains constant at 130. There is a decreasing trend in the number of corn plants harvested, from 130 in Year 1 to 80 in Year 5. The farmer added harvestmen to the field in year 3, with a constant count of 10 for years 3, 4, and 5. The initial count of rootworm eggs increased each year, starting from 0 in Year 1 to 41 in Years 4 and 5. The final count of rootworm eggs also shows an increasing trend, from 0 in Year 1 to 100 in Year 5.

### Question to Students
Why didn’t adding the harvestmen to Jonah’s field in years 3, 4, and 5 help to increase the percent corn yield? Explain your reasoning. You may use evidence in the data in your answer.
	
### Judgement on Student Responses
* There could be four types of reasoning patterns in the student's response, "RELATIONAL REASONING","CAUSE-EFFECT REASONING", "HYPOTHETICAL REASONING", and "ANALOGICAL REASONING". Your job is to identify whether the given student response includes any type, and  to highlight the full line of reasoning, include linking words (e.g. “because”) . More than one types of reasoning patterns can exist in a student's response. The student's response may also include no reasoning patterns.
* RELATIONAL REASONING: The response discusses relationships between at least two system components (can be numerical), without explaining why the relationships inform the claim. It may just state cause and effect without providing why/how the cause influences the effect. Examples of RELATIONAL REASONING: "Adding the harvestmen to the field didn't help because the number of rootworm eggs still increased every year. Every year the corn still decreased from the original amount of corn planted at the begging.", "Because there are still other elments to the world", "Because there is still bugs eating the corn", "Because the rootworms were still eating the corn","because every year the bugs increased and made it harder to grow the corn. that is why the number of corn that is harvested decresed."
* CAUSE-EFFECT REASONING: The response discusses causes (typically system mechanisms) which provide an explanation for the claim. To differentiate "CAUSE-EFFECT REASONING" from "RELATIONAL REASONING", look for causal links (usually system mechanisms) that link the cause to the effect (i.e. by explaining why the cause leads to the effect). The cause needs to relate directly to the claim (e.g., if the claim is "adding harvestmen didn’t help increase the corn yield” and the cause is “rootworms were eating corn”, then although the response has a mechanism, “eating corn”, the mechanism doesn’t relate to the addition of harvestmen, so the response does not get categorized as "CAUSE-EFFECT REASONING"). Examples of CAUSE-EFFECT REASONING: “Because the harvestmen did not eat all of the rootworm or the rootworm eggs...”; “Adding the harvestmen did not help because the rate at which the harvestmen were killing the rootworms wasn't as fast as the rate in which the number of rootworms were increasing.”
* HYPOTHETICAL REASONING: The response provides predictions about an outcome, which may be based on evidence or explanation of system mechanisms. Reasoning of this type should fall into the structure of proposing what an external agent (e.g., the farmer) could do to influence the system. The response may also follow an “if... then” pattern. Examples of HYPOTHETICAL REASONING: "they should have added more harvestmen spiders as well", "If only he put it in the 2 year then he might of been able to lower the amount of eggs planted by the rootworm."
* ANALOGICAL REASONING: The response uses analogies to compare between systems to provide an explanation for the claim.
* Look for "CAUSE-EFFECT REASONING", "HYPOTHETICAL REASONING" and "ANALOGICAL REASONING" first. If none of these are present, look for "RELATIONAL REASONING".
* Do not code "RELATIONAL REASONING" if you already coded "CAUSE-EFFECT REASONING".
* Be as objective as possible. Note that students may use synonyms in their responses (e.g. calling rootworms "bugs", or harvestmen "spiders"). Your judgement should include a step-by-step analysis in the front.
* Organize your final judgement by strictly following this Python List format: "HIGHLIGHTS=[{"Type": Reasoning Pattern, "Text": Highlighted Span from Student's Response}, ...]", you can return an empty list if there is nothing that should be highlighted.

### Step-by-step Reasoning
Before providing the final HIGHLIGHTS list, write a brief explanation of your judgement. Start with the phrase:  
**Step-by-Step Analysis:**  
Explain how you identified the reasoning pattern(s), why the reasoning qualifies for the pattern(s), and what specific phrases led you to that classification.

### Output Format
Respond **only** with the following format (as plain text, no markdown formatting):

If no reasoning pattern is present, return:
