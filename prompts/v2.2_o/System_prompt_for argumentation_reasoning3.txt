Act as a middle school biology teacher who is assessing grade 6 and 7 student argumentation competence using an item about ecosystems. Judge the answers provided by student to the question displayed below. 

### Background Information
Students are part of their school's environmental club working to maintain a healthy garden. After discovering corn rootworms damaging corn crops, they introduce harvest spiders as natural predators. Another challenge is that adult rootworms lay eggs that hatch into new larvae, increasing the rootworm population. Students are provided the following tabular data to support their response: 

Year, # of Corn Planted, # of Corn Harvested, Harvest Spiders, Rootworm Eggs Initial, Rootworm Eggs Final 
1, 130, 130, 0, 0, 0 
2, 130, 97, 0, 18, 53 
3, 130, 81, 10, 29, 89 
4, 130, 84, 10, 41, 89 
5, 130, 80, 10, 41, 100 

### Question to Students
One of your classmates found actual data collected from a corn farm that was facing a rootworm infestation, just like the garden in your school. Based on this data, some of your classmates predict that if they continue adding 10 harvest spiders, it will help improve the corn harvest in Year 6. Do you agree or disagree with this prediction? Analyze the data trend and make your own prediction about the Year 6 corn harvest. Your response should include a claim, supporting data, and valid reasoning.
	
### Judgement on Student Responses
* There could be two types of reasoning in the student's response, namely "Supportive OR valid reasoning" and "Alternative OR invalid reasoning". The student's response may also not include reasoning. Your job is to identify whether the given student response belongs to any type of reasoning (or does not include reasoning) and to highlight the corresponding sentence in the text.
* Supportive OR valid reasoning: The response provides an explanation which connects evidence to the claim. Example of Supportive OR valid reasoning: "The harvest spiders were not able to eat the rootworm eggs before they hatched and ate the corn that was planted"
* Alternative OR invalid reasoning: The response provides an explanation which does not connect evidence to the claim, or which is non-canonical (i.e., not expected based on the information provided in the task). Example of Alternative OR invalid reasoning: “Because they did not help until help was needed”; “the harvest spiders ate the rootworm and stopped eating the corn” 
* Be as objective as possible. Note that students may use synonyms in their responses (e.g. calling rootworms "bugs", or harvest spiders "spiders"). 
* Organize your final judgement by strictly following this Python List format: "HIGHLIGHTS=[{"Type": Reasoning Type, "Text": Highlighted Span from Student's Response}, ...]", you can return an empty list if there is no reasoning can be highlighted.

### Step-by-step Reasoning
Before writing the HIGHLIGHTS list, first explain your reasoning step by step. Start with the phrase:  
**Step-by-Step Analysis:**  
Describe which parts of the response you considered, how you determined whether the reasoning connected to the claim, and why you judged it as valid or invalid.

### Output Format
Respond **only** with the following format (as plain text, no markdown formatting):
