Act as a middle school biology teacher who is assessing grade 6 and 7 student argumentation competence using an item about ecosystems. Judge the answers provided by student to the question displayed below. 

### Background Information
Students are part of their school's environmental club working to maintain a healthy garden. After discovering corn rootworms damaging corn crops, they introduce harvest spiders as natural predators. Another challenge is that adult rootworms lay eggs that hatch into new larvae, increasing the rootworm population. Students are provided the following tabular data to support their response: 

Year, # of Corn Planted, # of Corn Harvested, Harvest Spiders, Rootworm Eggs Initial, Rootworm Eggs Final 
1, 130, 130, 0, 0, 0 
2, 130, 97, 0, 18, 53 
3, 130, 81, 10, 29, 89 
4, 130, 84, 10, 41, 89 
5, 130, 80, 10, 41, 100 

### Question to Students
One of your classmates found actual data collected from a corn farm that was facing a rootworm infestation, just like the garden in your school. Based on this data, some of your classmates predict that if they continue adding 10 harvest spiders, it will help improve the corn harvest in Year 6. Do you agree or disagree with this prediction? Analyze the data trend and make your own prediction about the Year 6 corn harvest. Your response should include a claim, supporting data, and valid reasoning.
	
### Judgement on Student Responses
* There could be two types of claims in the student's response, Correct claim and Incorrect claim. The student's response may also not include a claim. Your job is to identify whether the given student response belong to any type of claim (or does not include a claim) and to highlight the corresponding sentence in the text.
* Correct claim: The student states that harvest spiders will not work, or the corn yield will decrease. Examples of Correct claim: "Adding harvest spiders will not work", "Causing the corn harvested to decrease", "Adding the harvest spiders will not increase the percent corn yield"
* Incorrect claim: The student states that adding harvest spiders will work, or the corn yield will increase. Examples of Incorrect claim: "...which caused the corn yeild to increase", "The corn yield will increase"
* Be as objective as possible. Note that students may use synonyms in their responses (e.g. calling rootworms "bugs", or harvest spiders "spiders"). 
* Organize your final judgement by strictly following this Python List format: "HIGHLIGHTS=[{"Type": Claim Type, "Text": Highlighted Span from Student's Response}, ...]", you can return an empty list if there is no claim can be highlighted.

### Step-by-step Reasoning
Before providing the final HIGHLIGHTS list, write a brief explanation of your reasoning. Start with the phrase:  
**Step-by-Step Analysis:**  
Explain which parts of the student response you focused on, how you identified a claim, and why you classified it as correct or incorrect.

### Output Format
Respond **only** with the following format (as plain text, no markdown formatting):

Step-by-Step Analysis:  
(Your explanation here...)

HIGHLIGHTS=[{"Type": "Correct claim", "Text": "..."}, {"Type": "Incorrect claim", "Text": "..."}]

If no claim is present, return:
HIGHLIGHTS=[]
